This is an Django-based Pokémon REST API based on PokeAPI. Your job is to fix 5 issues:

1. Update `/pokemon` endpoint to include a Pokémon's type.
1. Implement Get Pokémon by ID
1. Implement Get Pokémon by Name
1. Implement Get Pokémon by Type

Please refer to the API Swagger documentation for clear specifications of the API's intended behavior. You can find the Swagger docs at http://localhost:3000/api-docs.
